The RAWG API is currently unavailable, some features of Gavilya no longer work.

<UpdateSection title="Monitoring" date={new Date("2021-12-06T15:40:32.659Z")}>
  We are closely monitoring the situation and will keep you updated about any significant developments.

  #### How Gavilya is affected
  Since the API isn't currently available, you'll see lots of error messages if you have linked your games to the RAWG database. However, this issue shouldn't cause a crash of the app.

  Here's what's new since the last update:

  - The RAWG API is still unavailable.
  - Gavilya's update system is working as expected, and there are no issues related to it.
  - We have changed the status to "Partial outage" since all of Gavilya's services except RAWG are working and performing as expected.
  - We won't update this status page until the next day; the issue may take some time to resolve.
  - This issue is **not** related to any Léo Corporation's service.

  _Thank you for your patience._

<UpdateSection title="Resolved" date={new Date("2021-12-07T14:24:34.302Z")}>
  The issue is now resolved. All Gavilya's services should work as expected.
